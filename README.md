# Single-Image-Reflection-Removal

Reflection interference removal based on layer extraction of an image using their relative smoothness.

Code for CVPR 2014 paper: [Single Image Layer Separation using Relative Smoothness](https://yu-li.github.io/paper/li_cvpr14_layer.pdf) (reflection removal only).

## About

Digital Image Processing course project focused on understanding the theory behind an image processing algorithm from a research paper, its documentation and implementation in code. 

Math behind the algorithm and each of its steps are explained in [documentacion.pdf](https://github.com/acampillos/Single-Image-Reflection-Removal/blob/main/documentacion%20.pdf)

Python implementation and comments on the algorithm: [reflection_removal.ipynb](https://github.com/acampillos/Single-Image-Reflection-Removal/blob/main/reflection_removal.ipynb)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Numpy
- OpenCV-Python
- Matplotlib

## Acknoledgement

Code is based upon one of the [author's implementation](https://yu-li.github.io/paper/li_cvpr14_layer.zip) in Matlab.
